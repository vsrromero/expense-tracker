# React-Minimal

## Creating an App
> npm
```sh
npx create-react-min my-app
npm install
```
>yarn

```sh
yarn create react-min my-app
yarn install
```

It will create a directory called my-app inside the current folder.
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure.
```sh
my-app
├─ README.md
├─ package.json
├─ public
│  ├─ favicon.ico
│  ├─ index.html
│  ├─ logo192.png
│  └─ manifest.json
└─ src
   ├─ App.js
   ├─ index.css
   └─ index.js
```

## Getting Started with React Minimal

Available Scripts in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` || `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build` || `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
